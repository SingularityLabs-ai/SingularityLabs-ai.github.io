**Summary**

A team of researchers has created a prototype artificial neuron that rivals the brain's immense efficiency. The neuron uses ions, not electrons, to carry information, which is similar to how the brain works. This could lead to the development of more energy-efficient and powerful artificial intelligence systems.

**Follow-up Questions**

* How does the artificial neuron compare to other artificial neurons that use electrons?
* What are the potential applications of this technology?
* What are the ethical implications of creating artificial neurons that mimic the brain?

### Additional Questions

* What are the challenges that need to be overcome before this technology can be widely used?
* How will this technology affect the future of artificial intelligence?
* What are the potential risks of this technology?
